## 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY - Recommended Actions

### 1. Plan Vue.js 2 to Vue 3 Migration (Quiz App)

**Location:** `etc/quiz-app/`  
**Current State:** Vue 2.6.11 (EOL December 31, 2023)  
**Recommended:** Migrate to Vue 3.x

**Why:**
- Vue 2 has reached end-of-life
- Security updates discontinued
- Better performance and modern features in Vue 3

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create a migration plan
- [ ] Review breaking changes in Vue 3
- [ ] Update dependencies (vue, vue-router, vue-i18n)
- [ ] Test quiz functionality thoroughly
- [ ] Update build configuration

**Estimated Effort:** High (2-3 weeks)  
**Timeline:** Within 6 months

### 2. Regular Dependency Updates

**Current Practice:** Manual updates  
**Recommended:** Automated dependency monitoring

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Enable Dependabot for automatic dependency updates
- [ ] Set up automated PR creation for dependency updates
- [ ] Configure version constraints appropriately
- [ ] Establish review process for dependency updates

**Example `.github/dependabot.yml`:**
```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  # Python dependencies
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "monthly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5

  # Node.js dependencies (quiz-app)
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/etc/quiz-app"
    schedule:
      interval: "monthly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
```

**Estimated Effort:** Low (1-2 hours setup)  
**Timeline:** Immediate

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Recommended Improvements

### 3. Add Automated Notebook Testing

**Current State:** No automated execution testing for Jupyter notebooks  
**Risk:** Broken code examples may go undetected

**Recommended Tools:**
- `nbval` - Validates notebook execution
- `pytest-notebook` - Pytest plugin for notebooks
- `papermill` - Parameterized notebook execution

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Set up nbval for critical notebooks
- [ ] Create GitHub Action workflow for notebook testing
- [ ] Document which notebooks should be tested
- [ ] Add test markers to notebooks

**Example GitHub Action:**
```yaml
name: Test Notebooks
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt nbval
      - run: pytest --nbval-lax lessons/3-NeuralNetworks/
```

**Estimated Effort:** Medium (1-2 days)  
**Timeline:** Next quarter

### 4. Implement Automated Link Checking

**Current State:** Broken links detected manually  
**Risk:** Poor user experience, outdated references

**Recommended Tool:** `markdown-link-check` or `linkinator`

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Add link checking to CI/CD
- [ ] Configure to run on PR and weekly
- [ ] Set up exclusion list for known slow/intermittent sites
- [ ] Document process for fixing broken links

**Example GitHub Action:**
```yaml
name: Check Links
on:
  pull_request:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday
jobs:
  link-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check@v1
        with:
          use-quiet-mode: 'yes'
          config-file: '.github/link-check-config.json'
```

**Estimated Effort:** Low (4-6 hours)  
**Timeline:** Next quarter

### 5. Address TODO/FIXME Markers in Notebooks

**Found Markers In:**
- `lessons/4-ComputerVision/06-IntroCV/OpenCV.ipynb`
- `lessons/4-ComputerVision/10-GANs/StyleTransfer_Keras.ipynb`
- `lessons/4-ComputerVision/10-GANs/GANTF.ipynb`
- Several others (approximately 10 notebooks)

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Review each TODO marker
- [ ] Prioritize based on educational impact
- [ ] Complete or document intentional incomplete sections
- [ ] Remove outdated markers

**Estimated Effort:** Medium (varies by item)  
**Timeline:** Ongoing maintenance

## 🟢 LOW PRIORITY - Enhancement Suggestions

### 6. Add Type Hints to Python Utility Files

**Current State:** No type hints in utility files  
**Benefit:** Better IDE support, documentation, error catching

**Example Enhancement:**
```python
# Current
def train_epoch(net, dataloader, lr=0.01, optimizer=None):
    ...

# With type hints
def train_epoch(
    net: nn.Module, 
    dataloader: DataLoader, 
    lr: float = 0.01, 
    optimizer: Optional[torch.optim.Optimizer] = None
) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    ...
```

**Files to Update:**
- `lessons/4-ComputerVision/07-ConvNets/pytorchcv.py`
- `lessons/4-ComputerVision/07-ConvNets/tfcv.py`
- `lessons/5-NLP/18-Transformers/torchnlp.py`
- Other utility files

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Add type hints incrementally
- [ ] Run mypy for type checking
- [ ] Update contributing guidelines to encourage type hints

**Estimated Effort:** Medium (1-2 weeks)  
**Timeline:** Future enhancement

### 7. Consider Dataset Hosting Strategy

**Current State:** Large datasets included in repository (3.7GB total)  
**Alternative:** External hosting (Azure Storage, GitHub Releases)

**Benefits:**
- Faster repository cloning
- Reduced storage costs
- Better version control for code vs. data

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Identify large datasets (>10MB)
- [ ] Evaluate hosting options
- [ ] Create download scripts
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Migrate datasets incrementally

**Estimated Effort:** High (2-3 weeks)  
**Timeline:** Long-term improvement

### 8. Markdown Documentation Linting

**Recommended Tool:** `markdownlint` or `remark-lint`

**Benefits:**
- Consistent documentation style
- Catch formatting errors
- Improve readability

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Configure markdownlint rules
- [ ] Add to pre-commit hooks (optional)
- [ ] Fix existing linting errors
- [ ] Document style guide

**Estimated Effort:** Low (1 day)  
**Timeline:** Optional enhancement

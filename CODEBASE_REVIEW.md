## 8. Specific Issues & Recommendations

### 8.1 Critical Priority

**1. Update nltk Package (SECURITY)**
```python
# In requirements.txt, change:
nltk==3.8.1
# To:
nltk>=3.9
```
**Reason:** Fixes unsafe deserialization vulnerability  
**Impact:** High - security risk  
**Effort:** Low - simple version bump

### 8.2 High Priority

**2. Upgrade HTTP Links to HTTPS**

Links to update in README.md:
- `http://makeapullrequest.com` → `https://makeapullrequest.com`
- `http://soshnikov.com` → `https://soshnikov.com`
- `http://Tensorflow.org` → `https://www.tensorflow.org`
- `http://pytorch.org` → `https://pytorch.org`
- `http://github.com/Microsoft/ML-for-Beginners` → `https://github.com/Microsoft/ML-for-Beginners`

**Reason:** Security best practice, avoid MITM attacks  
**Impact:** Medium - security and trust  
**Effort:** Low - simple find/replace

### 8.3 Medium Priority

**3. Pin Python Version in environment.yml**

```yaml
# Add specific Python version
dependencies:
  - python=3.11  # or 3.10 for broader compatibility
```
**Reason:** Reproducible environments  
**Impact:** Medium - compatibility  
**Effort:** Low - version specification

**4. Plan Vue.js Migration**

Consider migrating quiz-app from Vue 2 to Vue 3:
- Vue 2 reached EOL December 31, 2023
- Vue 3 has better performance and TypeScript support
- Breaking changes require careful planning

**Reason:** Maintenance and security  
**Impact:** Medium - future maintenance  
**Effort:** High - significant refactoring

### 8.4 Low Priority

**5. Address TODO/FIXME Markers**

Review and resolve TODO markers found in notebooks:
- Some notebooks have incomplete sections
- Could enhance learning experience

**Reason:** Completeness  
**Impact:** Low - educational quality  
**Effort:** Varies by item

**6. Consider Adding Python Type Hints**

Add type hints to utility files for better IDE support:
```python
def train_epoch(net: nn.Module, dataloader: DataLoader, 
                lr: float = 0.01) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    ...
```

**Reason:** Better tooling, documentation  
**Impact:** Low - developer experience  
**Effort:** Medium - requires review of all files

- ✅ Linting configured (ESLint)
- ➖ No unit tests visible
- ✅ Build system configured

**Notebooks:**
- ➖ No automated execution testing
- ➖ Manual validation required

### 12.2 Testing Recommendations

For an educational repository, current testing is acceptable. However, could consider:

1. **Notebook Execution Testing:**
   - Use `nbval` or similar to validate notebooks execute
   - Catch broken code examples before students encounter them

2. **Link Checking:**
   - Automated link validation to catch broken external links
   - Tool: `markdown-link-check` or similar

3. **Documentation Linting:**
   - Markdown linting for consistency
   - Tool: `markdownlint`

**Priority:** Low - Current approach is acceptable for educational content
